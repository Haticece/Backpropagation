# Backpropagation in Neural Networks

## Overview
This repository provides a step-by-step implementation of the **Backpropagation** algorithm used for training neural networks. The notebook demonstrates the fundamental workings of the algorithm, from initializing a neural network model to calculating gradients and updating weights to minimize the loss function. This is a key technique used in deep learning to optimize neural networks.

## Key Concepts
- **Neural Networks**: A network of nodes (neurons) that process data, and are trained using supervised learning to make predictions.
- **Backpropagation**: A supervised learning algorithm used for training artificial neural networks. It updates the model's weights using gradients calculated through the chain rule.
- **Gradient Descent**: An optimization algorithm that updates the weights of a neural network by minimizing the loss function.
- **Loss Function**: A function that measures the error between the predicted and actual values. The goal is to minimize this error.

## How Backpropagation Works
Backpropagation works by computing the gradient (or derivative) of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases of the network. These gradients are propagated backward through the network to update the weights.

### Steps Involved:
1. **Forward Pass**: Input data is passed through the network to get the output.
2. **Loss Calculation**: The difference between the predicted output and the actual label is calculated using a loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error or Cross-Entropy).
3. **Backward Pass**: The gradients of the loss function are computed with respect to the network's weights using the chain rule.
4. **Weight Update**: Weights are updated using an optimization algorithm (e.g., Gradient Descent) to minimize the loss.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- `numpy` (for numerical calculations)
- `matplotlib` (for plotting and visualization)
- `pandas` (optional, for data handling)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
```

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in a Python environment.
3. Execute each cell in sequence to run the backpropagation algorithm and see the updates to the neural network's weights.
4. Analyze the plots and loss curve to understand how the network learns over time.

## Example Code
Here’s an example of how the backpropagation algorithm is implemented in the notebook:

```python
import numpy as np

# Example forward pass (1-layer neural network)
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Example backpropagation (gradient calculation)
def backpropagation(X, y, weights, learning_rate):
    # Forward pass
    output = sigmoid(np.dot(X, weights))
    
    # Calculate error (loss)
    error = y - output
    
    # Backward pass (gradient calculation)
    gradients = np.dot(X.T, error * output * (1 - output))
    
    # Update weights
    weights += learning_rate * gradients
    return weights
```

In this simple example, the algorithm computes the output, calculates the error, propagates the error backward to compute the gradients, and then updates the weights.

## Results and Evaluation
The notebook includes visualizations of the loss function during training. As the model trains using backpropagation, you will see the loss decreasing over time, indicating that the network is learning and the weights are being optimized correctly.

## Conclusion
This notebook provides a hands-on demonstration of the **Backpropagation** algorithm, one of the most crucial techniques in training neural networks. Understanding this algorithm is essential for anyone working with deep learning models. By applying backpropagation, we can optimize the weights of the network and improve its ability to make accurate predictions.
